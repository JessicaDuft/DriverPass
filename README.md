Please review the [Business Requirement Document ](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/DriverPass/blob/main/Business_Requirements.docx) attached to this repo. This document displays the skills I learned in CS255 System Analysis and Design 
<br/>


This document is just one example of the ability I have gained throughout my time at SNHU to effectively communicate with stakeholders and team members by using industry appropriate tools. In this document I analyze client requirements,fucntionality, limitations and built a GANT chart that would allow the team to bring the project to completion in 15 weeks. 
<br/>


•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
<br/>
DriverPass is a company who recognized the trouble that many have when attempting their first ever DMV driver’s test in order to obtain their driver’s license. The company wanted to create a system that offered users accurate and up-to-date learning modules and practice quizzes. Additionally, DriverPass also would offer in-person driving courses with a certified instructor. The system would automate manual processes such as uploading documents, booking appointments, and paying for subscriptions as well as offer several different subscription plans that could be purchased and paid for securely online. 
<br/>
<br/>

•	What did you do particularly well?
<br/>
I did a good job analyzing the system and determining all of the required functionalities and requirements that the client needed in order to create DriverPass.
<br/>


•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
<br/>
I would revise my GANTT chart and try to make each task and date easier to read. I would also edit the visual aspects of the chart to make it more appealing overall. 
<br/>
<br/>

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
<br/>
I interpreted the user’s needs by thoroughly analyzing the transcript and creating an in depth review of requirements, user interface expectations, assumptions and limitations. It is crucial to consider the user’s needs when designing a system. The user is paying you to assist with building a specific system and it is literally your job as a developer to meet the client’s needs. If you don’t consider the client’s needs when designing a system, important requirements could be left out of the system which would result in a dissatisfied and disappointed client. 
<br/>

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by very thoroughly analyzing client expectations and requirements. Taking each requirement and functional expectation into account a system can be designed that meet’s and exceeds the client’s expectations. In the future I would approach things the same way, I would take my time and very thoroughly analyze what exactly the client would like the system to do and accomplish.
